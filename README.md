# AID on PI
Python module that interacts with **AID** - the **Automated Intrusion Detection System** - which can be found right [here](https://github.com/kedeggel/aid) on Github.

The module contains the **Sensor class** and the **create_sensor script** (_On TODO yet_)

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Create new sensor by running ```python create_sensor``` which leads you through the whole creation steps. After these process the file ```sensors.conf``` is generated.

## Hints
It is strongly recommended not to change entries in config file manually to avoid incompatible sensor entries.
